# Reinforcement_Learning_TicTacToe
Exploring 'Reinforcement Learning' via Tic Tac Toe implementation

### Learning to teach a machine to learn
I'm excited and curious about various machine learning techniques.
After listening to a few podcasts that piqued my interest, I
thought I would just jump in with both feet. I haven't done a lot
of research on reinforcement learning and I don't have a very good
understanding yet, but my hope is that this project can serve as
reinforcement learning for me!

### Goals and Ambitions: Symmetry Recognition
After getting some of the basic mechanics working, my goal is to
add a few expansions. In particular, awareness of board symmetry.
I read that machines take more iterations to learn, partly because
they don't see flip or rotational symmetry of a board. This seems
like something that can be built into the modeling and analysis
of the board, so I aim to try.
